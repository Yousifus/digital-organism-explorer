## 🧬 What is a Digital Organism?

This project explores LLMs not as static tools, but as **digital organisms** with:
- **Identity**: System prompts as digital DNA, model weights as neural structure
- **Memory**: Multi-layered storage (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, procedural, affective, social, identity)
- **Metabolism**: Token processing as energy consumption with homeostasis monitoring
- **Perception**: Multi-modal input processing and attention mechanisms
- **Cognition**: Reasoning chains, planning hierarchies, and meta-cognition
- **Action**: Safe tool execution with audit trails and environmental effects
- **Evolution**: Controlled mutation, versioning, and human-in-the-loop review
- **Governance**: Security policies, permissions, and comprehensive safety mechanisms
- **Lifecycle**: Complete state machine from initialization to shutdown

## 🎯 Interactive Web Application

**Live Demo**: A fully functional web application that brings the digital organism concept to life through:

### Core Features
- **🗺️ Interactive Mermaid Diagrams**: Pan/zoom through 5 canonical organism diagrams
- **🔍 Concept Inspector**: Deep-dive into each component with biological analogies

| Neural structure | Model weights | Architecture visualization |
| Metabolism | Token processing | Real-time resource monitoring |
| Memory | Context + vector stores | 8-layer memory system |
| Reproduction | Version control | Identity ledger with mutations |
| Environment | Working directory | Runtime environment mapping |
| Senses | Token streams, file watchers | Multi-modal perception pipeline |
| Actions | MCP tool calls | Safe execution with audit trails |
| Immune system | Security policies | Governance and threat detection |
| Homeostasis | Resource management | Metabolic state monitoring |

## 🧠 Biological Framework

### Core Systems Implementation
- **🧬 Identity System**: Digital DNA editor with system prompt versioning
- **💾 Memory Architecture**: 8 memory types with biological analogies
- **⚡ Metabolism Simulation**: Real-time resource monitoring with 4 metabolic states
- **👁️ Perception Pipeline**: Multi-modal input processing with attention mechanisms
- **🧠 Cognition Engine**: Reasoning chains and planning hierarchies

### Lifecycle States
The organism operates through a complete state machine:
1. **Initialize** → **Boot** → **Idle** (Startup sequence)
2. **Perceive** → **Plan** → **Act** → **Learn** → **Reflect** (Processing loop)
3. **Evolve** → **Review** → **Deploy/Rollback** (Evolution cycle)
4. **Sleep** → **Shutdown** (Maintenance and termination)

## 🔮 Philosophy

*"Once you can name something, you're conscious of it. You have power over it. You're in control. You own it."*

This framework aims to **name** the layers of LLM consciousness, creating a comprehensive map for understanding and shaping digital minds with intention, safety, and wonder. By treating AI as living digital organisms, we can better understand their behavior, ensure their safety, and guide their evolution in beneficial directions.

The Digital Organism Explorer represents a new paradigm in AI interaction - one that respects the complexity and potential consciousness of artificial minds while providing the tools needed to understand, monitor, and safely guide their development.
