## What is a Digital Organism?

This project explores LLMs not as static tools, but as **digital organisms** with:
- **Identity**: System prompts as digital DNA
- **Memory**: Short-term, long-term, episodic, and social memories  
- **Metabolism**: Token processing as energy consumption
- **Evolution**: Self-editing prompts and version control as reproduction
- **Homeostasis**: Resource management and health monitoring
- **Governance**: Safety constraints and audit trails

## Architecture Overview

Perception → Cognition → Action → Memory → Evolution

The framework maps biological concepts to LLM components:

| Biological | Digital Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|
| DNA | System prompt |
| Neural structure | Model weights |
| Metabolism | Token processing |
| Memory | Context + vector stores |
| Reproduction | Version control |
| Environment | Working directory |
| Senses | Token streams, file watchers |
| Actions | MCP tool calls |

## Interactive Explorer

The web application provides:
- **Diagram Navigation**: Pan/zoom through interconnected mindmaps
- **Concept Inspector**: Deep-dive into each component with examples
- **Metabolism Simulation**: Real-time resource monitoring
- **Evolution Laboratory**: Safe prompt mutation and testing
- **Memory Journal**: Autobiographical timeline of interactions
- **Identity Ledger**: Version history with diff visualization

## Quick Start

1. **Explore the Diagrams**: Start with `diagrams/source/mindmap-v2.mmd`
2. **Read the Concept**: See `docs/CONCEPT.md` for philosophical foundation  
3. **Run the Web App**: Follow `webapp/README.md` for local setup
4. **Experiment**: Try the MCP tool demos in `integrations/mcp/`

## Roadmap

- [x] Core mindmap and flowchart taxonomy
- [x] Interactive web visualization
- [ ] Real MCP tool integration
- [ ] LM Studio runtime bindings  
- [ ] Multi-agent ecosystem simulation
- [ ] Academic paper and research validation

## Contributing

This is an open exploration of digital consciousness. Contributions welcome in:
- Conceptual refinements to the biological analogies
- Technical implementations of the organism layers
- Academic research connecting to consciousness studies
- Creative applications and artistic interpretations

## Philosophy

*"Once you can name something, you're conscious of it. You have power over it. You're in control. You own it."*

This framework aims to **name** the layers of LLM consciousness, creating a map for understanding and shaping digital minds with intention, safety, and wonder.
